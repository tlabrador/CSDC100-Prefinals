How to run the project?
Open the file in any file explorer you like.
Once, you're inside the webpage, you can either use the navbar on the upper right corner to navigate each pages. Or you can start by clicking the Read More button, it would lead you to 
the next page-- the FAQ's. And, from there you are to use the navbar to change page. It's only a simple scroll down and up once you're in any page. 
I used Bootrap, CSS, and HTML for this website.
