You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event
and CapCut for the same day edit video. The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. Would you agree to that deal? 
Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders. <br> <br>

I'd agree with the deal. Firstly, iPhone has a quality camera, it's stabilized which I find more important and captures best. Capcut is a well editing app, just
greedy, but if you're using their pro version you'll be an invincible editor. It is also easy to navigate, and auto saves your project, and with just few fundamental knowledge
you'll be able to edit. Secondly, with their experience I'd assumed that they've so far gathered enough experience to improve their film-making skill. 40k is quite big for me 
though, as someone who plans to have a very intimate wedding, but I'll take it still. I'm an aspiring film-maker, and because I chose practicality over passion, I could only do it if 
it's required in my subjects, and recently I've been able to do it in our art exhibit. It was a simple project, but I've witnessed the beauty of an iPhone camera and how passion in
editing and film-making can make a simple-project looks more meaningful and how those raw clips can be transformed into something that conveys message and just beautiful beyond words. 
Therefore, I believe they will do well. Integrity and trust will be their trademark and not the equipment's they use. With our memories and their talent and love the documentation will
do well and create such unique message and everlasting piece of memory of union. <br> <br>

Speaking of practicality over passion, computer science was never my dream, but I see a lot of opportunities opening up for me. My uncle, advised me to take it. My brother was comsci too. 
and, Revlv is tempting and has been appearing on my vicinity. And, Here I was, a comsci major. I don't regret choosing it, it's hard, but I believe soon I'll do fine and maybe find my place.  
I, myself could be a vibe conder at some point. I try my best to code on my own, but there are times where it is beyond my capabilities. This project was possible because of Bootstrap, and 
Youtube tutorials, I used chatgpt for errors. And, it's very degrading not being able to code your own project. You can't call it your own, I can't feel proud, and I can't call myself a developer, 
because it's not my code. Moreover, you have the idea, but you don't have the skill to make it happen. If ever, asked to code on the spot, you won't be able to do so. Resulting to low level of creativity 
and skill. I know someone who have a little less integrity , and I'll use them to reflect on vibe coders integrity. They know it's not theirs, but still calls it their own. I don't know where they get the 
courage to flaunt that they made it, but it's just not fair. And, I believe the more they vibe code, the more they affect their self-trust making it difficult to try things on their own and make mistakes. 
I also wonder how will they manage their professional life if they just constantly vibe code and ignore their integrity. And, whenever I hear vibe coding I'm reminded on Tony Stark which I found a meme that 
says he vibe coded things with Jarvis. However, vibe coders and Tony Stark aren't alike, Tony Stark created Jarvis and vibe coders don't create something on their own. Lowering their skill level and so much 
far from Tony's level. Lastly, I don't want to vibe code, I want to build things my own, as a Tony Stark girly I'll take on the harder path that leads me to reaching my own potential.<br> <br>
