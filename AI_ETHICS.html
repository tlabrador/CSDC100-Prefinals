                    <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to solve major challenges in education,
                    enhance teaching and learning methods, and support faster progress toward achieving SDG 4. Yet, its rapid 
                    advancement also introduces a range of risks and concerns that are evolving faster than current policies and 
                    regulatory systems can keep up with. <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/digital-education/artificial-intelligence" class="links">(UNESCO)</a>

                    and education is right at the center of this transformation. Generative AI, in particular, is opening up opportunities we couldn’t
                    have imagined a few years ago. But with those possibilities come real challenges, and as educators, we need to be prepared to navigate both."

                    As AI continues to advance, we need to grow alongside it. We can’t allow ourselves to become dependent and let our own abilities weaken 
                    as AI rises. Using AI isn’t forbidden, but using it responsibly is essential, especially in education. As you go through this page, you’ll 
                    find tips and guidelines on how to use AI ethically and wisely. By following them, you protect your integrity and continue 
                    to develop your own competence. Think about it being hygienic mentally!

      <h4>How to use AI Responsibly?</h4>
      <p>
        1. DON'T SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA <br>
        - Never input names, grades, or any identifying information. Even if a platform claims to be secure, you can’t be sure how data will be stored or used. Stick to general or anonymized data to protect your privacy. <br><br>

        2. DON'T TRUST AI OUTPUTS BLINDLY <br>
        - Always review and revise. Think of AI as a draft assistant, not as a content expert. <br><br>

        3. BE TRANSPARENT  <br>
        - It opens space for honest conversations.  <br><br>

        4. EVALUATE AI RESPONSES  <br>
        - Evaluate AI content with critical eye, accuracy, bias, and missing voice all matters. <br><br>

        5. USE AI TO SUPPORT THINKING, NOT REPLACE IT <br>
        - Think of AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for your creative work. Let it spark ideas or offer multiple perspectives, but push yourself to synthesize and reflect. The goal isn’t to do less thinking, it’s to think more deeply. <br><br>

        6. CITE YOUR SOURCES, EVEN WITH AI HELP <br>
        - Even when AI gives you a paragraph or idea, it’s essential to trace it back to actual sources. If the content came from your prompt, say so. If it paraphrases something published, make sure you cite that properly. Modeling this helps you understand the value of intellectual honesty. <br><br>

        7. DON'T RELY ON AI FOR FACTS <br>
        - AI often sounds confident even when it’s completely wrong. Always double-check facts, figures, and claims. <br><br>

        8. REFLECT ON BIAS IN AI-GENERATED CONTENT <br>
        - AI reflects the biases of the data it was trained on. If it produces stereotypes, erases perspectives, or centers dominant narratives, call that out. <br><br>

        9. USE AI TO SAVE TIME, NOT CUT CORNERS  <br>
        - Yes, AI can save you time, checking for errors in your code, generating questions, and summarizing texts. But that’s different from letting it do the work for you. <br><br>

        10. USE AI TO BRAINSTORM NOT TO FINALIZE <br>
        - Need ideas for script hooks or project prompts? Great, ask AI. But don’t stop there. Brainstorming is only the beginning. You’ll still need to apply your judgment, values, and realities to turn those ideas into something useful. <br><br>

        <h3> 1. Encourage transparent use</h3>
        <img src="Ethics_images/transparency.jpg" alt="FAQ">
        <p>
	If students use AI to assist with their work, encourage them to be transparent about it. This could be as simple as
     adding a note at the end of an assignment, such as, “I used ChatGPT to rephrase this paragraph” or “I asked Claude
    to help brainstorm ideas.” Presenting AI as a tool—not a replacement for thinking—helps foster the right mindset. 
    It’s also a good practice to have students indicate what changes they made after using the tool.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="image-card">
        <h3>2. Set clear, specific guidelines</h3>
        <img src="Ethics_images/bounderies.jpg" alt="FAQ2">
           <p>
	If students aren’t aware of the boundaries, they’ll create their own. At the start of the year, or before a major writing or 
    research assignment, take the time to clearly explain your expectations for AI use. Can students use it to generate ideas? To 
    edit drafts? Make sure to specify what’s permitted, what isn’t, and why it’s important. Put these guidelines in writing and
     review them regularly. Some educators even involve students in creating AI use policies, which can foster understanding and 
     greater commitment.
    </p>
    </div>

      <div class="image-card">
        <h3>3. Foster a culture of integrity</h3>
        <img src="Ethics_images/INTEGRITY.jpg" alt="FAQ">
        <p>
        This goes beyond AI. When students are both challenged and respected, they’re less likely to cheat. Make learning goals 
        ransparent. Offer second chances when appropriate. Emphasize process over product. AI isn’t just a discipline issue—it’s 
        a teachable moment.

        <h3>4. Integrate AI responsibly</h3>
        <img src="Ethics_images/integrate_responsibly.jpg" alt="FAQ">
        <p>
	AI can be a helpful academic tool when used thoughtfully. Apps that check grammar, explain complex readings,
    or help create study questions can save time and strengthen understanding. Don’t rely on AI to do your assignments
    for you. Instead, use it to draft ideas, clarify confusion, or practice skills. This keeps you in control of your learning
    and demonstrates responsible, critical use of AI.

        <h3>5. Promote AI Literacy</h3>
        <img src="Ethics_images/AI-Literacy..jpg" alt="FAQ2">
           <p>
	Increasing public awareness and understanding of AI is essential to empower individuals to critically evaluate AI-driven
    technologies and advocate for responsible AI practices.

        <p>
    AI is not a magic bullet that can solve any problem or perform any task. It has its own limitations and weaknesses, such as
    data quality, interpretability, reliability, and accountability. You should understand the limitations of the AI system you are
    using and not rely on it blindly or uncritically. You should also be aware of the potential errors, failures, and risks that the

      <h4>Cross-check with reliable academic sources</h4>
      <p>
        You must check the ideas in the GenAI text are true. To do this identify the facts you want to check, 
        and do a search in academic databases to see if you can verify the information. You can use the JCU OneSearch 
        library database, or Google Scholar. If you can not verify the information you must consider the GenAI output unreliable.
    </p>
    
        <h4>Check citations provided by GenAI Output</h4>
    <p> Sometimes GenAI will provide citations for the information it presents. However, GenAI is known to create inauthentic references.
        If GenAI provided a source you must still authenticate that source. Verify it by searching for the exact paper in an academic database.
        If you cannot find the paper, it is likely inauthentic, and you cannot rely on the information generated. 
    </p>
 
        <h4>Validate AI outputs in depth using multiple sources</h4>
    <p>Sources used to train the AI tool data sets likely won't be quoted directly in the AI's outputs. Since it might be hard to pinpoint the original
        sources, similar sources can be used to verify the information.</p>

    <p>Does the AI response directly address the user’s query?</p> 

        
        <h4>Accuracy / Faithfulness:</h4> 
    <p>Does the source material support the answer? Are there signs of hallucination?</p>

        <h4>Bias or offensive content</h4> 
    <p> Does the output include offensive or inappropriate content? Are relevant perspectives excluded?</p>

     <h4>Comprehensiveness</h4> 
    <p> Does the answer consider multiple perspectives or angles, especially in academic contexts?</p>

    <h4>Behavior when information is lacking</h4> 
    <p> Does the answer acknowledge uncertainty or produce misleading content? (Also known as noise reduction and negative rejection.)</p>

      <h4>What is BIAS?</h4>
      <p>
        Bias in AI can be defined as the error that leads to unfair decisions. This can also be called machine learning bias or algorithmic
        bias and this can happen due to various sources such as data collection, algorithm design, human biases, etc.
        The identification and addressing of bias is important to maintain fairness and equality in the decision-making process while using AI
        systems for all users. This promotes trust in AI technologies and also a good unbiased environment for all people irrespective of their
        race, gender, or background. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/fairness-and-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/" class="links">(GEEKSforGEEKS)</a>
    </p>

     <h4>What is FAIRNESS?</h4>
      <p>
        Fairness in artificial intelligence can be defined as an attempt to correct the algorithmic bias such as race or ethnicity etc in an automated
        decision-making process. It is very important to address these algorithmic biases and mitigate them to follow the ethics of AI. This concept
        is important in artificial intelligence because it is important for artificial systems to function with fairness so that they don't favor or
        disadvantage certain people based on their gender, race, or ethnicity. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/fairness-and-bias-in-artificial-intelligence/" class="links">(GEEKSforGEEKS)</a>
    </p>

     <h4>Addressing FAIRNESS and BIAS in AI</h4>
      <p>
       To address fairness and bias in AI, Geeks for Geeks provided various approaches, techniques, and strategies can be employed throughout the AI development lifecycle:  <br>  <br>
    
       Data Collection and Preparation: <br>
       Objective: Ensure that the training data is representative, balanced, and free from biases.  <br>
       Actions: <br> 
        Identify and mitigate biases in the training data.  <br> 
        Collect diverse and representative data that includes all relevant groups and populations. <br> <br>
       
        Algorithmic Design and Development: <br> 
        Objective: Develop algorithms and models that are fair, unbiased, and equitable. <br>
        Actions: <br>
        Design algorithms that account for and mitigate biases. <br>
        Regularly evaluate and test algorithms for fairness and bias using appropriate fairness metrics and criteria. <br><br>

        Fairness-aware Learning and Training: <br>
        Objective: Train AI models in a way that promotes fairness and reduces bias. <br>
        Actions: <br>
        Incorporate fairness constraints and objectives into the learning and training process. <br>
        Employ techniques such as adversarial training, reweighing, and fairness regularization to mitigate biases and promote fairness. <br><br>

        Evaluation and Validation: <br>
        Objective: Evaluate and validate the fairness and performance of AI systems. <br>
        Actions: <br>
        Use fairness metrics and criteria to assess and measure the fairness of AI systems. <br>
        Conduct thorough testing and validation in diverse and representative scenarios and environments. <br> <br>

        Transparency and Explainability: <br>
        Objective: Increase the transparency and explainability of AI systems to understand and mitigate biases. <br>
        Actions: <br>
        Develop interpretable and explainable AI models and algorithms. <br>
        Provide explanations and insights into the decision-making process and outcomes of AI systems to identify and address biases. <br>

        As for my own guidelines, it's more about keeping my integrity and consciousness clean and also for my own growth and personal development. <br> <br>

1. BE HONEST
- There's no good feeling than knowing that you've kept your integrity and used use own capabilities to do what seems impossible. I believe that's where growth starts.
Use AI for assistance, don't let it replace you. Do it yourself, and accept that failure will always be there, but that's where we start to learn.
So, start by being honest- honest to yourself and to your peers. And, you'll soon realize that YOU CAN! and you don't need AI to do it for you. <br> <br>

2. AI DETECTORS
- When you ask for AI assistance for academic writings, go and paste it on AI detectors. And, once you see the result, you would not be proud.
Use it more frequently, and sooner or later you'll start relying on your own to write or do your work, than relying to much on your AI friend. I use Quillbot and ever since
checking AI works on Quillbot, I learned to trust myself more and allow myself to look foolish at my first time until I've mastered it on my own than relying on AI 
to do my stuff. If AI detectors don't eat your conscience, please for your own sake learn to be uncomfortable, you'll succeed in time.  <br> <br>

3. TRUST YOUR TIME
- We all have our peak and prime, you'll get yours too. Only if, you learn how to ethically use AI and do more of your works on your own.
Spend more time dealing with how things can be solved, than copy and pasting everything on AI. Each and everyone of us have our own time, and while it's
not your time yet, hone it yourself. Think of Deku from My hero academia.  <br> <br>

4. Use it smart
- We're smarter than AI. We can use it smart. Treat it as an assistant only, but never to replace your
ability to think and do. Be more ethical about your use.
